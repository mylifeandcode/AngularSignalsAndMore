    We haven't made much use of <em>OnPush change detection</em>, but it's something that can improve performance a bit.

    From the <a href="https://angular.dev/best-practices/skipping-subtrees#using-onpush" target="_top">official docs</a>:
    <blockquote cite="https://angular.dev/best-practices/skipping-subtrees#using-onpush" class="mt-2">
      OnPush change detection instructs Angular to run change detection for a component subtree only when:
      <li>The root component of the subtree receives new inputs as the result of a template binding. Angular compares the current and past value of the input with ==.</li>
      <li>Angular handles an event (for example using event binding, output binding, or &#64;HostListener) in the subtree's root component or any of its children whether they are using OnPush change detection or not.</li>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This must be used carefully, as it could have unintended side-effects. The component below uses OnPush change detection.
      It will react to changes made to its &#64;Input(), and from an event (like a button click) but not from within itself. 
      An interval is updating the <em>currentTime</em> variable every second, and logging it to 
      the console, but because of the OnPush change detection, its latest value will only be rendered when something else triggers 
      change detection.

    Another thing to watch out for: Using OnPush on a component that has child components. Even if the child components don't 
    use OnPush, the fact that they are <em>within</em> a component that does will affect how 
    change detection works for them.
